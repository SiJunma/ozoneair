                    If you return one or more items, we recommend that you pause the Klarna invoice or have it paused so that the invoice can be temporarily stopped free of charge, so that the purchase can be returned first.

                </p>

                <p>
                    You have a legal right of withdrawal of 14 days (return period) from the moment you receive an item ordered by you. If you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal, you must notify us within 14 days by telephone or email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ozoneair.com">customerservice@ozoneair.com</a>.

                    You have the right to examine the product to the extent necessary to determine the properties or function of the product.

Such a price reduction may not exceed the total price of the product. Products that have been used for more than 12 hours are considered to have been used to a greater extent than necessary to determine function and properties, and therefore a return will not be accepted in such cases.
